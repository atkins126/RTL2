# Elements RTL (a.k.a. RTL2)

<img src="https://docs.elementscompiler.com/API/ElementsRTL/ElementsRTL-256.png" width="128" style="float: right;" />
Elements RTL is an open source library for Elements that aims to create a common set of classes that can be used on all supported target platforms – .NET, Cocoa and Java – in order to enable more code sharing between these platforms. It is available for all four languages and on all four platforms.

Use of the Elements RTL library in your projects is entirely *optional*. By default/design, Elements projects start out working directly against the native APIs of each platform. It is your decision whether to add a reference to Elements RTL and to start using its APIs as well – usually if your intention is to create code that can be shared across platforms.
